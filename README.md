# Detecting Skin Cancer Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network
> In this notebook, we're going to build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow & Keras. The objective is to build a model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Our deep convolutional neural network will analyze dermoscopic images and warn the dermatologists about the signs of melanoma. It can play a vital role in earlier and faster diagnosis and can reduce a lot of manual effort needed in the process.

## General Information
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:
- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion
